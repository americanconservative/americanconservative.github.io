Liberals have this way of demonizing capitalism, and trying to make you believe that it's somehow inherently evil. Let me give a basic breakdown of how and why it works, to help spread the *knowledge* around, instead of the *wealth*.

Let's start with an illustration. There's this guy, Levi, who decides to make and sell some jeans. His jeans are of decent quality, and he's a heck of a sales guy, so in time he builds a name for himself and creates a demand for his product. Mind you, he's making these jeans in his garage, and building this business all on his own. One day, he realizes that he's spending too much time making jeans, and not enough time selling them. He makes an important decision and invests into his business by hiring someone. The plan works. He is now free to do more sales, while his jeans are still being made. Before long, Levi is investing in factories and employees across the nation. He's built a company from nothing, and enjoying the fruits of his labor.

It doesn't take long for his childhood friend, Lucky, to realize that if Levi can do it, so can he. Lucky makes jeans of equal quality for the same price, but he's willing to live with less money for himself, so he pays a higher wage to his workers. Both companies become nationally renowned.

In time, Levi's employees realize that they can make more money with Lucky. Suddenly, Levi has a problem. He has to pay his employees equal wages, or he won't have his jeans made. He either has to take less money for himself, or raise his prices. He knows that raising his prices will reduce his sales, so naturally, he opts to lower his income to keep his business alive. Competition.

Eventually, the general public learns that these jean making employees are earning ridiculous wages. Both companies are stormed with qualified people, willing to work for less. Competition. 

There comes a point where everyone is working for the smallest amount they are willing to. The Levi and Lucky companies, fighting for each other's market share, innovate new ways to make their products better for the same price, or more efficiently for a lower price. Competition.

If they cut too many corners their price goes down, but so does their quality, they lose.

The fear of greed is over emphasized. The greed will always be usurped by competition. There will always be someone willing to do it for less.

The latest liberal rant that capitalism is evil, stemmed from the [price hike][1] of the drug Daraprim. This may have some basis in greed, but I'm not going to judge that either way. Friends, capitalism prevails. It didn't take long for a [generic variant][2] to become available at $1 per pill versus the $13.50 per pill of Daraprim, **before** it's price was hiked. There will *always* be someone willing to do it for less money. This generic variant has it's own issues though, as it's not yet FDA approved. Government regulation. An FDA approval is likely to take *several years* and *millions of dollars*. Despite that, if the doctors and patients are comfortable with the risk, they are able to prescribe and purchase this alternative, and they will be saving money to boot.
