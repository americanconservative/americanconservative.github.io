We've all heard of Kim Davis by now. If not, just [read the news][1]. This issue has been pretty divisive, as most are of late, but this one really seemed to even divide Christians within the church. As a Conservative American Christian, let me give you a breakdown of why her actions were wrong, and why she was **not** jailed for her beliefs.

First, I'd like to point out that I am not _for_ homosexual marriage. I believe that homosexuals in relationships are missing something, and they can't seem to figure out what. They believe that getting the state to recognize their union with a license will fill a certain void. It won't. We could give them a whole stack of licenses, and a standing ovation from every citizen of this great country, and the void will remain. This is because their relationship is incapable of true fulfilment. It is outside of God's design. I can't blame Davis for not wanting her name on the license, I would feel the same way. But, her continued method of protest is not doing anyone any favors.

In America, we have this little thing called the [First Amendment][2], which in part, protects the free exercise of religion. The _belief_ that homosexual relationships are legitimate could be construed as a type of religion, thereby protected. But don't quote me on that, [I'm not a lawyer][3]. We have to be careful. The first time you allow the government to say that someone can't do something that you feel is wrong, you give the government the power to do the same thing to you.

Think about it. Would you allow a Muslim county clerk to withhold a marriage license because you didn't wear a burka? Would you allow a Hindu governor to outlaw hamburgers? I don't think so. The founding fathers did **not** intend for government to be _controlled_ by religion. Or vice-versa. That is what is meant by the "separation of church and state." They **did** intend for religion to be represented **in** government. The people that make up the country should be represented as fairly as possible, religion included.

Simply put, Davis was jailed because she didn't do her job. By not doing her job, she was held in contempt of court. Being jailed for her beliefs would _literally_ mean that she was arrested for **saying** "Homosexual marriage is wrong". She did say that, but that is not **why** she was detained.

She is back at work, and likely to find herself in even [more trouble][4] by doctoring up the marriage licenses that she _is_ issuing. If your job description changes out from under you, and you are no longer able to perform your duties as assigned, then the logical thing to do is resign, like [so many others did][5]. That is the method of protest that I would have taken.

I think that Davis, and the rest of us, should follow some [sound advice][6] on how to be a Christian in a secular world.
