I am an American. I am a conservative. Notice the order.

I call out Americans for not being *conservative* enough.

Conversely, I call out conservatives for not being *American* enough.

I call it like I see it. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not an expert. Sometimes, I will be wrong. Sometimes, you will disagree with me. But that is what makes America great.

I will use my freedom of speech as I see fit. I will probably offend you. Too bad.
